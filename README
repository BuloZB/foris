KRUci
======

KRUci is Remote Uci - it is a web GUI for configuration of system via Nuci,
i.e. using Netconf.

Nowadays, KRuci is in early stage of development and almost everything in it
is a possible subject to change, thus there's no guaranteed API stability
and all the parts should be used externally only with extreme caution, if ever...
Oh, and the name is a DEFINITE subject to change ;)
